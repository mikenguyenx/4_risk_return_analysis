# Risk Return Analysis

This Jupyter notebook contains code that automates a quantitative analysis using statistical algorithms to evaluate investment options for inclusion into client portfolios based on key risk-managment metrics: the daily returns, standard deviations, Sharpe ratios, and betas.

## Technologies

Programming Language: Python

Interactive Development Environment: JupyterLab


Libraries: 
- Pandas - A Python library that is used for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization. 
- Pathlib - A Python module that provides an object-oriented interace to working with files & directories.
- Numpy - A Python library that is used for scientific computing and data analysis and provides a number of mathematical functions that can be applied to large sets of numerical data such as linear algebra operations, Fourier transforms, and random number generation. 
- Matplotlib - A Python for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. It provides a wide variety of customizable visualizations, including line plots, scatter plots, bar plots, histograms, heatmaps, and more.

### - Seaborn - A Python data visualization library based on Matplotlib which provides a wide range of visualizations including scatterplots, line plots, bar plots, heatmaps, and more.


Operating System(s):  Any operating system that supports Python, including Windows & macOS.

## Installation Guide

To run the application:

1. Clone the repository: 'git clone "https://github.com/mikenguyenx/4_risk_return_analysis"'
2. Confirm dependencies are properly installed by activating Conda dev environment and then running the following code:
```
XXX```
3. If your development environment is missing either package, you can directly install it.

To install ...
XXX

Launch Jupyter Lab: `jupyter lab`
4. Install the 'python-dotenv' Library
With the python-dotenv library, you can read key-value pairs from an environment file (.env) and add them as environment variables.

To install this library, run the following command in your terminal:
```
XXX
```



 Open `risk_return_analysis.ipynb` in Jupyter Lab to view and run the data analysis code.

## Usage

To use the crypto arbitrage analysis script:

1. Open `risk_return_analysis.ipynb` in Jupyter Lab.
2. Run the code cells by clicking on the run button or by pressing the "Shift + Enter" key combination to load and preprocess the data, and generate visualizations
3. The script uses Pandas to collect CSV data into the Jupyter notebook file for analysis using summary statistics and Matplotlib for visualizations.

Below are screenshots of examples of results from the analysis:
