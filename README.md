# Fund Portfolio Risk Return Analysis

This Jupyter notebook contains code that automates a quantitative analysis using statistical algorithms to evaluate investment options for inclusion into client portfolios based on key risk-management metrics: the daily returns, standard deviations, Sharpe ratios, and betas. The analysis includes four new investment options (Soros, Tiger Global, Berkshire Hathaway, & Paulson) for inclusion in the client portfolios compared to the S&P 500 Index.

## Technologies

Programming Language: `Python 3.7.13`

Interactive Development Environment: `JupyterLab`


Libraries: 
- `Pandas` - A Python library that is used for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization. 
- `Pathlib` - A Python module that provides an object-oriented interace to working with files & directories.
- `Numpy` - A Python library that is used for scientific computing and data analysis and provides a number of mathematical functions that can be applied to large sets of numerical data such as linear algebra operations, Fourier transforms, and random number generation. 
- `Matplotlib` - A Python for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. It provides a wide variety of customizable visualizations, including line plots, scatter plots, bar plots, histograms, heatmaps, and more.


Operating System(s):  Any operating system that supports Python, including Windows & macOS.

## Installation Guide

To run this analysis, make sure you install the necessary dependencies:

1. Install `Python`: `https://www.python.org/downloads/`
2. Install and run `Jupyter Lab`:  `https://jupyter.org/install`
3. Install the necessary libraries using pip, the package installer for Python:
```
pip install pandas pathlib numpy matplotlib
```
4. Clone the repository: 'git clone "https://github.com/mikenguyenx/4_risk_return_analysis" using git or download the ZIP file and extract it to a local directory.


## Usage

To run the script for the Fund Portfolio Risk Return Analysis:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory with the analysis.
1. Launch Jupyter Lab: `jupyter lab`
2. Open `risk_return_analysis.ipynb` in Jupyter Lab.
3. Run the code cells by clicking on the run button or by pressing the `Shift + Enter` key combination to load and preprocess the data, and generate visualizations
4. The script uses `Pandas` to collect CSV data into the `Jupyter notebook` file for analysis using statistical algorithms and `Matplotlib` visualizations to analyze fund portfolio performance, risk, volatility, and portfolio returns.
